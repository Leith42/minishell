# minishell

As the name suggest, this project aim to produce a functional miniature version of a shell like bash, zsh and so on.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn about processes at a basic level by creating a "mini" shell.
This shell is very simple and doesn't need to contain complex functions like piping, redirection and so on.
It contains the following builtins:
```
cd   echo    env    setenv    unsetenv    exit
```
## How to use it
```
$ make
$ ./minishell
```
Once in the shell, you can execute the builtins or any other simple command line that works on any other shell.
